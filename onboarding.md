# CHIRAL Bangladesh Onboarding Information

# Mission Statement

The mission of CHIRAL Bangladesh is to advance scientific research and education in public health, bioinformatics, geospatial health and health data science by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, supporting underprivileged students, and promoting impactful research that addresses critical health challenges in Bangladesh and beyond.

## Expectations
**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and career development. As a member of CHIRAL, you are expected to participate fully in the team. In general, members are expected to follow working hours that include 4 hours/day to facilitate discussion within the group. 

**Mentor Role:** Mentors role is to facilitate your success as well as that of your project. Within your project, mentors will serve as a sounding board for ideas, will help you plan your project, and will help to devise experiments to test your hypotheses. To facilitate your success, mentors will help you to plan your training, to devise a career plan that can take you to where you want to go, to advise you on your project-risk portfolio, and to provide guidance on other elements of career and project development as needed.

**Deadlines:** Our team is working hard to develop a reputation for high-quality science that is well presented. We all benefit from this reputation, but we must also work to maintain it. Abstracts for meetings must be shared with all co-authors, including mentors, at least one week prior to the deadline for submission. Failure to abide by this guideline will result in missing whatever the opportunity in question is.

Trainees in the CHIRAL will often receive opportunities to present their work at scientific conferences. These presentations reflect on the entire team. Oral presentations on projects must be presented to the research team during a braintrust meeting, and CHIRAL members are expected to address feedback that is provided. Once a project has been presented once and feedback incorporated, additional presentations are optional in advance of meetings. Poster presentations should be shared in the `#general` slack channel at least a week before printing.

**Code of Conduct:** At CHIRAL Bangladesh, we are committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and harassment-free environment for all members and visitors. Discrimination or harassment based on gender, gender identity, age, disability, appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic will not be tolerated. This includes offensive comments, inappropriate images, intimidation, stalking, disruption, unwanted physical contact, and sexual advances. All members are expected to adhere to these guidelines, and any harassing behavior must cease immediately when asked. Please refer to the full Code of Conduct for more detailed information on our expectations. We prioritize cooperation to ensure a professional and inclusive atmosphere for everyone.

**Authorship:** Our team follows the [ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) defintions of the roles of authors and contributors to our manuscripts.

**Ethics:** We expect CHIRAL members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the team. We expect that CHIRAL members will design experiments/study in a manner that minimizes both bias and self deception. We expect that CHIRAL members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code and results openly with the scientific community. We expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing. Plagiarism is not tolerated. While a full enumeration of ethical considerations is outside of the scope of this document, CHIRAL provides a document that we recommend.

In addition, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns that you have at any point with the director.


# Communication
## General
**Slack:** CHIRAL Bangladesh operates remotely and uses Slack for internal communication. Members should prioritize Slack messages over emails for faster response times. If an email is necessary, please ensure it is also acknowledged in Slack. All members should join the following channels: `#general`, `#meeting`, and `#random`. 

**Social Media:** CHIRAL members are encouraged to share research and updates via public social media. If a member associates their profile with CHIRAL Bangladesh, they must adhere to the CHIRAL’s code of conduct. If required by an employer or collaborator, members should include a disclaimer stating that opinions are personal and do not represent CHIRAL Bangladesh. Please read [Social Media Policies for CHIRAL Bangladesh](https://github.com/chiralbd/onboarding/blob/main/social-media-policies.md). 

**IP/Openness:** Intellectual property and openness policies align with CHIRAL’s agreements with funding sponsors and institutional policies. Any concerns should be discussed with the director.

**Accounts:** CHIRAL members must create and maintain accounts for:
- GitHub (organization)
- Slack (workspace)


# Meetings
**Scrum:** Our team's scrum process involves three components:
1. A weekly kick-off meeting at `8:30 AM` `Friday` morning where individuals will lay out their goals for the week on Zoom.
2. A demo day meeting at `8:30 AM` `Saturday` afternoon where team members show off an accomplishment from the week in 3 minutes or fewer. This could be a new figure, section of a paper, some code that they are particularly happy with, or something that we learned from a paper, poster, or research presentation.
3. A daily virtual scrum update on Salck.

We use Google Slides to share figures or paper sections for the demo day meeting; the link is pinned in the `#meeting `channel on Slack and is not intended to be shared outside the lab. 

## Meeting
- Meetings are scheduled for one hour on the third Friday of the month. All members of the CHIRAL are expected to attend. Meetings are expected to be a supportive environment for learning, constructive criticism, help, and scientific discussions.
