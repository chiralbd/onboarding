## Expectations
### Your Role
As a member of CHIRAL Bangladesh, you are expected to take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and professional development. We encourage active participation in team discussions and collaboration. CHIRAL members are expected to follow standard working hours from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM (local time) on weekdays to facilitate group discussions. Meetings will generally be scheduled within these hours to ensure accessibility for all members. However, certain essential meetings, such as weekly planning and project presentations, may occasionally fall outside of this timeframe, depending on the availability of all stakeholders.

For in-person researchers, CHIRAL Bangladesh provides dedicated workspace for those attending three or more days per week. Those attending less frequently will use shared or hotelling spaces. Remote researchers must have an approved Remote Work Agreement, aligning with CHIRAL Bangladesh’s policies on remote participation.

# Communication

If an email is necessary, please ensure it is also acknowledged in Slack. All members should join the following channels: `#general`, `#meeting`, and `#random`. 

**Social Media:** CHIRAL members are encouraged to share research and updates via public social media. If a member associates their profile with CHIRAL Bangladesh, they must adhere to the CHIRAL’s code of conduct. If required by an employer or collaborator, members should include a disclaimer stating that opinions are personal and do not represent CHIRAL Bangladesh.
